  - question: "Q: Why 10 Days?"
    answer: >
      Much the same scuba divers must adapt their bodies to deeper depths so do we need to get accustomed to working with the amount of energy and light that is generated at our retreats. And this takes time.
      It takes time to prepare your psycho-physical state to attend the retreat.
      It takes time to get accustomed to the retreat energetic field.
      It takes time to become still anddive into the true depth of our being.
      It takes time to smoothly return from this depth and go back to our homes.
      It takes time to learn how to live from this depth once we return to our lives.
      The smooth entry and exit from the retreat space allows us to focus on the joy, happiness and pleasure you can attain from deep practice. And remember, every second of each stage of this retreat is dedicated to helping you reach an even deeper state of stillness from which the magic of true awakening happens.


  - question: "Q: Suitability for beginers"
    answer: >
      If you have not practiced any spiritual techniques or theory before, the retreat will still be effective and beneficial for you. In fact, previous experience may sometimes hinder your progress as it may cause you to hold onto labels and concepts that could impede your ability to perceive the practice freely.
      Experienced practitioners will also be asked to put their knowledge aside during the retreat and follow the recommendations of the instructor as if they were new to the practice.
      The most important factor that determines the effectiveness of the retreat is your willingness and determination to follow all the guidelines and instructions provided by the instructors.


  - question: "Q. Preparing for the retreat"
    answer: >
      To prepare for the retreat, it is recommended that you follow the daily routine outlined in the preparation course and the recommendations provided by your guide and the retreat instructors. Take the time to learn all the elements presented in the online preparation course, and do not hesitate to ask your guide any questions you may have.
      It is important to exclude the use of alcohol, drugs, plants of power, food additives, or smoking cigarettes at least five days before the retreat, during it, and for five days after it. Additionally, switch to a vegan diet for at least five days before the retreat, during it, and for five days after it.
      Comply with the stillness mode, which means refraining from listening to music, watching movies and videos, reading books, intimate relationships, or anything that may excite your mental activity for at least five days before the retreat, during it, and for five days after it.
      It is recommended that you wear comfortable clothes that enable you to participate in the physical exercises during the retreat.
      By following these guidelines, you can prepare yourself both physically and mentally for the retreat, which will enhance the effectiveness of the experience.
        - question: "Q. Phone and gadget usage during the Retreat"
    answer: >
      To maximize the effectiveness of the retreat and allow for a complete change in your usual actions and mental state, all phones, computers, and other gadgets must be handed over to the organizers for the duration of the retreat.
      While phones and other devices have become a ubiquitous part of modern life, they are associated with numerous daily tasks and activities that excite mental activity. To truly understand and experience the School’s methodology deeply, it is important to calm your mind and cultivate inner stillness.
      If you have any concerns about issues that may arise during the retreat, please make arrangements before the retreat begins to ensure that they are taken care of. By fully immersing yourself in the retreat and adhering to the guidelines, you will be able to gain the most benefits from the experience.


  - question: "Q. Purpose of Pre-Retreat Restrictions"
    answer: >
      The restrictions before the retreat, such as switching to a stillness mode, excluding certain foods, and avoiding alcohol and tobacco, are put in place to create a deeper immersion in the practice. By removing external distractions and sources of mental activity, participants can enter a deeper state of stillness and accumulate internal energy.
      Listening to music, watching movies, reading books, having sex, and overeating can all create mental activity and distract from the deeper work that is necessary during the retreat. By avoiding these activities before and during the retreat, participants can better focus on the practices and teachings and allow for a more transformative experience.
      The purpose of the pre-retreat restrictions is to help participants achieve a deeper understanding of their nature and realize their potential more quickly. By committing to the stillness mode and following the guidelines provided by the instructors, participants can create an optimal environment for inner work and personal growth.


  - question: "Q. Medical Conditions, Injuries, and Special Diets?"
    answer: >
      If you have any medical conditions, injuries, or are on a special diet recommended by your doctor, please inform us in advance before starting the retreat, preferably when filling out the questionnaire. This will allow the instructors and organizers to be aware of your health status and provide you with any necessary recommendations to ensure your safety and well-being during the retreat.
      We take your health and safety seriously, and we want to ensure that all participants have a positive and transformative experience. By informing us of any medical conditions or limitations, we can tailor the retreat experience to best accommodate your needs.


  - question: "Q. Why exclude the use of alcohol and tobacco?"
    answer: >
      The use of alcohol and tobacco is prohibited during the retreat as the practices and activities involved in the retreat already put a significant strain on the body and mind, including the cleansing of accumulated tension and mental programming.
      In addition, alcohol and tobacco can also have a negative impact on one’s mental clarity and ability to fully engage in the retreat practices. By abstaining from these substances, yoiu can better focus on the inner work and fully immerse themselves in the retreat experience.
      Combining the retreat with the consumption of alcohol or other psychotropic substances may result in serious harm to your health.

  - question: "Q. Why switch to a vegan diet? (excluding all animal products)"
    answer: >
      Since 75-80% of the energy we have is spent on digesting food, we can help our body get rid of accumulated stress by switching to a plant-based diet. This diet requires less energy to digest. It means that your body-mind will cleanse and rebuild faster.
      Additionally, a vegan diet is often rich in nutrients, fiber, and antioxidants, which can support overall health and well-being. It can also promote a more mindful and compassionate relationship with food and the environment.


  - question: "Q. How do I get a reference?"
    answer: >
      Just give us a note and we scedule an interview with an awakened
      person of our community. Of course we can provide you with references
      of participants but the best thing is to visit us on one of your open
      session on Sundays. So you get the first impression of our
      methodology.


  - question: "Q. Is this a religious community?"
    answer: >
      No, the methodology is not affiliated with any religion or political
      system. The knowledge we share is present in all major religions and
      has been condensed into the most effective form for you in order to
      transform the modern life.
