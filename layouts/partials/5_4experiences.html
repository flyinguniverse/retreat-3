          <h3>Guidance of an enlightened teacher</h3>
          <p>
            Genadiy, our teacher, reached full spiritual realization at the age
            of 27. Now his mission is to transmit knowledge all over the world.
            All retreats are energetically guided by him while also joining in
            person to answer questions given by the retreat participants.

          <h3>A unique work with our spirit</h3>
          <p>
            Each retreat is unique and is tailored to the group. The energy of
            the teacher's field triggers the inner transformation of the spirit
            of each participant, which triggers powerful natural cleansing
            processes through the body.

          <h3>Experiences of higher levels of consciousness</h3>
          <p>
            Thanks to our teacher and a large global team, we create a special
            energy field transmitted to you through the retreat instructors,
            which helps to effectively and gently undergo inner transformations
            and to have a personal experience of awakening and higher levels of
            consciousness.

          <h3>Deep self-observation</h3>
          <p>
            The “Depth of The Problem” refers to the level of control the mind
            exerts over our lives and the entanglement that keeps us bound to
            this illusion. During the retreat, you will be able to see this
            reality in order to be able to overcome it.
