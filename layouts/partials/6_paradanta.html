          This is a 30 day on-site course where participants go into an even deeper depth than a retreat and receive their personal
          “Consonance”  used for meditation as part of the school’s methodology.

Those who finish the Paradanta Meditation course have the option to become student candidates in one of our
study centers and have a chance to take part in a more advanced level of education.

This includes Daily practice with our global team, regular satsangs with Genadiy and taking an active role in awakening the world.
