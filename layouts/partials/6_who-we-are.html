          World of Awakening is an international spiritual school dedicated to one goal. Exiting the cycle of samsara/matrix, also known as enlightenment or ascension in one lifetime.

It is a direct continuation of an unbroken chain of enlightened teachers and students from Western Europe, sometimes referred to as the school of “Primordial Sound”. Paradanta Meditation is a unique practice which is a direct part of the school that currently only Genadiy teaches in the world.

This knowledge was kept alive and given to only a select few until now. Given the state of the world, the global process of awakening and the speed of human evolution, this knowledge is now more important than ever. As a result, Genadiy, our teacher, began establishing our school in its modern form in Riga, Latvia circa 2010.

What makes the school so unique is that the methodology has been modified to fit modern people and keeps being improved by our teacher Genadiy.

So far, the school has helped more than a 100 of its students to cross the point of awakening. And helped thousands heal, find their purpose and begin their spiritual journey.
