Started his spiritual journey at 18 with the practice of Reiki, Glubinaya Kasaniya (Deep Touch), Western Tarot and Osho meditations.

During that time He has served in the Israeli Defence Force and later on became a mostly self-taught Cyber Security Expert. All while maintaining an inner clarity that it is all temporary because a deeper spiritual journey awaits ahead.

And this change occurred just before Covid had started after he read a book by Arun (A disciple of Osho) sharing his experience of being under the guidance of an enlightened teacher.

This pushed him to find an enlightened teacher himself eventually leading him to World of Awakening which is led by Genadiy â€“ an enlightened teacher. This became a shifting point in his life and he directed his life towards the path by leaving his previous career and choosing to live in one of the schools retreat centers.

Today he is a Reiki & Glubinaya Kasanya master, and a World of Awakening Instructor. He lives in the USA with the aim of building a retreat center capable of helping others join the path towards total freedom, happiness and the full realization of ones potential beyond what we can ever imagine.
