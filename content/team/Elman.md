Elmanâ€™s spiritual seeking began when he was 35 after a climbing expedition on a 7000 meter peak in Pamir mountains. After two years of an intensive inner search he found a teacher then an awakening happened. Since then a profound shift in consciousness happened and a gradual process of becoming aware of deeper truths about himself and the world around him.
